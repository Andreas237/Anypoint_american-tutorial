Anypoint Studio and Mulesoft:

This project is an introduction into Mule integrations through the Anypoint Studio.  It is incredibly basic, but was an excellent introduction into the product and power of Anypoint Studio and the Mulesoft domain.  Unfortunately I moved before the class could be completed.

Shout out to Brandon Grantham (Github granthbr) for an awesome class.
